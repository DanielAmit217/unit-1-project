# Sandwich Building Game
![game main screen screenshot](./assets/main-screen-shot.png)
## The game
This [_game_](link-to-game) is a point/time based game!\
The goal of the _game_ is to make as many sandwiches as you can within a minute. But be careful-because you have to get as many points as you can on the way, for each currect ingredient you make, you get a point!\
__I__ chose this _game_ because when we first were introduced to the convept of the project, I wanted to make something that I know I used to play when I was little.\
If you grew up in Israel in the early 2000's, you probably remember a game named [__"Falafel king×´__](https://www.falafelgame.com/eng/falafel.html).\
I wanted to make something that hit home, so I landed on making a food game.
### Planning
I started out _planning_ the game by trying to write down how would I go about making it, which in the end came back to bite me in the ass. since I had to change my mvp's a few times.\
Nevertheless this is my original [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Unit-1-project-25363d523fef80ed9ca9d67f855eb1bb?source=copy_link)

### Attributions: 
99% Of the code written is written by me (well, a lot of help from Raul tbh). 
So in terms of attributions i have two specific concepts I found online:\
* [Button animation](https://codepen.io/ibrahim-anwar/pen/empJeja) - I wanted to have cool animation for the button, and overall wanted to level up the looks of the game so I was scrolling on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/) and stumbled upon these button animations, of which I used the ripple, with help from Raul
* Random number generator - I wanted a random number generator that outputs A number between given values, so the code for it i found on google.
* Shake effect - I wanted the cutting board to shake when the wrong number of ingredients was put in to submit, so i looked online for a simple shaking animation on css which i found from google.

### Technologies used
For this Game I used:
1. JavaScript
2. Css
3. HTML

### Plans for the future
I definitly want this game to be A lot more flushed out in the future, as currently it is a simple score based game and there is no real competition or srtategy.
1. Add costumer orderes - make this game closer to the [Flipine Studios](https://www.flipline.com/) Papa Louie games, have costumer orders which you get punished for making wrong.
2. Background music - I want to make background music that gets more intense the less time you have left.
3. Better graphics - the current live updating graphics on the game are really simple, so maybe make the sandwich that builds up on the cutting board prettier.
4. Definitly want to change the comparison mechanic to not compare strings, but rather compare key values, less error prone
